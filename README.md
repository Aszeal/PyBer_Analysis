# The PyBer Analysis # 
 ## Overview of Analysis ##
I was assigned the task to analyze date and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at a company called PyBer. If there are any disparities, I will discuss what they are and recommend strategies on how to address them head on.

## Results ##


- Based off of the **Summary** information, I can conlude the follwoing:


   - Rural customer are more willing to find their own forms of transportation.
      - May have a smaller pool of consumers.
      - Rural customers also are charged the most per fare on average.
      - Rural Pyber drivers earn the most fare on average. 
   - Suburban customers use Pyber service more less than Urban customers.
      - Suburban customers are in the middle on all the metrics.  
   - Urban customers are a majority of their consumer base.
      - Urban customres on average are using the product the most.
      - Urban drives earn the least amount of fare per ride than other city types.

## Summary ## 
After analyzing all the information, I have three recommendations for the decision-makers at Pyber. But first, I need to address the **disparities** in the data. Based off of the data, it appears that the more customers use the product the **less** the **Drivers** make per fair. Laslty, there are **twice as many Urban Drivers** than there are rides. 

My three recommendations are the following:
1. Reduce the amount of drivers in Urban areas so that the current driver see increased fares per ride
2. Focus more on accumulating more rides in Rural areas
3. Look to focus on more marketing tactics in Suburban areas to get them to use the product more.

In conclusion, following the recommendations may lead to increased profits and reduced expenses.
