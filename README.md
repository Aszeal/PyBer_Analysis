# The PyBer Analysis # 
 ## Overview of Analysis ##
I was assigned the task to analyize date and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at a company called PyBer. If there are any disparities, I will discuss what they are and recommend strategies on how to address them head on.

## Results ##
- Based off of the **Summary** information, I can conluded the follwoing:
   - Rural customer are more willing to find their own forms of transportation.
      - Rural customers also are charged the most per customer on average.
      - Rural Pyber drivers earn the most fare on average. 
   - Suburban customers use Pyber service more less than Urban customrs.
      - Suburban customers are in middle on all the metrics.  
   - Uban customers are a majority of their consumer base.
      - Urban customres on average are using the product the most.
      - Urban drives earn the least amount of fare per ride than other city types.

## Summary ## 
After analyzing all the information, I have three recommendations for the decision-makers at Pyber. But first, I need to address a **disparity** in the data. Based off of the data, it appears that the more customers use the product the **less** the Drivers make per fair.
